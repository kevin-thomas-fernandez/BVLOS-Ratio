If there is a conflict between the definitions of this part and the definitions specified in § 1.1 of this chapter, the definitions in this part control for the purposes of this part: Associated Elements means those elements that are not directly affixed to an unmanned aircraft and are necessary to interact with the unmanned aircraft for safe flight during all normal, abnormal, or emergency flight operations. Command and Control Link means the command and control data link which connects the unmanned aircraft and the ground control station for the purposes of managing the flight. Conformance monitoring means the real-time ability to determine whether an unmanned aircraft is flying in accordance with its operational intent, and to share situational awareness data with relevant airspace users when off-nominal or contingent situations occur. Detect and avoid means the ability for an unmanned aircraft system to see, sense, or detect aircraft or other hazards and to make a flight adjustment to avoid a collision hazard. Flight coordinator means an individual who monitors an unmanned aircraft system operating under this part and that can control, initiate emergency actions, or issue commands to the unmanned aircraft during flight. Ground control station means the associated element that communicates with and controls the unmanned aircraft. Hazardous material means a material as defined in 49 U.S.C. 5102(2) and 49 CFR 171.8. Life-limited part means any part for which a mandatory replacement limit is specified by the manufacturer of the unmanned aircraft and is documented in the maintenance instructions. Operational intent means a volume-based representation of airspace encapsulating the intended flight path for an unmanned aircraft operation, comprising one or more overlapping or contiguous 3-dimensional volumes of airspace combined with a beginning and ending time for each volume. Operations personnel means a person who is performing a safety function employed by, or used by, an operator under this part. Operator means a person that conducts operations under this part. Package delivery means the delivery of goods, materials, or supplies from a business or commercial location to a residential or business end user. Safe distance means the minimum distance that is necessary to avoid a collision hazard with another aircraft. Strategic deconfliction means the use of an interoperable strategic conflict detection and resolution capability to mitigate the risk of collision between participating unmanned aircraft. Strategic conflict detection means the process of identifying overlapping operational intents among unmanned aircraft. Strategic conflict resolution means the process of resolving overlapping operational intents among unmanned aircraft.

Aggregate flight data must be provided to FAA, and unmanned aircraft reliability data must be provided to the manufacturer, or allow the manufacturer to access the data, at a minimum of once each calendar month. (2) Unmanned Aircraft. A list of unmanned aircraft registration and serial numbers used in operations must be provided to FAA a minimum of at least once each 12 calendar months. (3) Interruption reports. A summary of occurrences must be provided no later than the end of the 10th day of the following month in which the occurrence took place. (4) Service difficulty reports. Reports of failures, malfunctions, or defects must be submitted to the manufacturer not later than seven (7) days after the occurrence. When additional information becomes available, including information from other persons, operators must submit it as a supplement to the first report. (5) Security Occurrences. Reports of security-related occurrences must be submitted to FAA not later than 96 hours after the occurrence. When additional information becomes available, including information from other persons, operators must submit it as a supplement to the first report within a reasonable timeframe.
